ImageeEditing in shaders:
    without compute shaders earler either rasterizing a squad in fragment shader of transform feedback in vertex shader could be used;
    Use ssbo(shader Images or imageVariables)(image load store) instead of fbo to render to texture;check buffer textures:
    Just to access images (or data in buffer )using non normalized coordinates(like array) use buffer textures: to read write use load store with gimageVariable
    similarly to read and write to use image load store(accesed with non normalized indices just ing image coords not tex coords)
    Use atomic counter if ssbos not supported in vertex ,fragment shaders;




//temperature ,tint,exposure ,saturation,clarity,blacks ,whites,shadows,highlights,contrast,dehaze ,vibrance;


Tomorrow:
Lights vs colors
input and output check to see if ouput bins can be obtaind from bins and eqbuffer from histogram Table;
//draw output histogram to compare;,add C,M,Y to histogram auto options
//option 2 in non glCompute;,output histogram total count not matching check;
//hsi
..MONOCROME SET auu hues to same and check changing sat //Groma gray+monochrome set one of hsi to const and vary other



//Day after:
    Transforms ,Hue;




    FUTURE:
    Shaders have lot of duplicated code use proper manager;




IMPROVE:
Visiblity implemented only for sliders;



openglINof:
instead of frambuffer use image variables in gragmeth shaders
Imagevarriable bound texture backing buffer as texture buffer instead PIXelUnapcBUffer
